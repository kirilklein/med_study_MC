alpha0_dic.pkl: alpha0, every dictionary entry corresponds to one variable simulation setting
	the dictionary values are lists, every list entry corresponds to on prevalence
	The simulated prevalence is first averaged over 1000 datasets, then bisection is performed
beta0_exp_ls.pkl: For every setting a-f beta0_exp is determined as described in data_austin2010
				such that the incidence is 0.1
